Just some cli script I've put together to help me manage my iTunes library.


ScriptBridge and macports doesn't work as expected, nor did osa. Settled for appscript, although it isn't macruby compatible yet.

TODO

- Clean up project.
- Some encoding error is causing names to be misread and comparrisson to fail. Work on that.
